        Initializes the Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm.

        Parameters
        ----------
        objective_function : function
            The fitness function to evaluate the solution domain.
        display_function : function
            At the end of each generation, it is possible to call the display 
            function to see the state of the algorithm and useful statistics.
        optimal_fitness : float
            The solution that wants to be reached.
        chromosome_set : str
            A set of characters used in the chromosome.
        chromosome_length_set : list
            A list of sizes that the chromosome can be assumed.
        population_size : int, optional
            The number of individuals present in each generation, by default 30.
        max_generation : int, optional
            A maximum number of generations, by default 100.
        crossover_rate : float, optional
            Crossover probability, a float between 0 and 1, says how often 
            crossover will be performed. If there is a crossover, 
            offspring is made from parts of the parents' chromosome, otherwise, 
            if there is no crossover, offspring is an exact copy of the parents.
            Crossover is made in hope that new chromosomes will have good parts 
            of old chromosomes and maybe the new chromosomes will be better, 
            by default 0.7.
        mutation_rate : float, optional
            Mutation probability, a float between 0 and 1, says how often parts 
            of the chromosome will be mutated. If mutation is performed, part 
            of the chromosome is changed. Mutation is made to prevent the GA 
            from falling into a local extreme, but it should not occur very 
            often, because then the GA will in fact change to a random search, 
            by default 0.05.
        length_mutation_rate : float, optional
            Length Mutation probability, a float between 0 and 1, says how 
            often a change in size of chromosome will occur. The lengths of 
            both the parent chromosomes are checked and the chromosome whose 
            length is smaller is taken as parent 1. If the lengths of both the 
            chromosomes are the same, the exchange doesn't happen. Then, two 
            crossover points are picked randomly for the parent 1. 
            The bits in between the two points are swapped between the parent, 
            by default 0.
        growth_rate : float, optional
            In growth mutation, the chromosome is enlarged, by default 0.5.
        shrink_rate : float, optional
            The purpose of shrink mutation is to reduce the length of the 
            chromosome, by default 0.5.
        prc_tournament_size : float, optional
            The percentage of the population that will form a comparison set in 
            tournament selection, a float between 0 and 1, by default 0.1.
        candidate_size : int, optional
            The number of candidate chromosomes that can be selected as 
            parents, by default 2.
        niche_radius : float, optional
            Niche Radius is the distance threshold below which two individuals 
            are considered similar enough to affect the niche count. 
            The concept of Niche was introduced to ensure the diversity of 
            individuals and prevent individuals converging into a narrow region 
            of solution space, the range of niche is a spherical area. It is 
            fixed by the user at some estimate of the minimal separation 
            expected between the goal solutions, by default 1.
        multithread_mode : bool, optional
            By default False.
        history_recover_fitness : bool, optional
            If a solution is already seen, the algorithm takes the old value 
            without computing the objective function, by default False.
